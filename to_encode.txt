TATYANAS LETTER TO ONEGIN

I write what more is there to say?
How shall I add to my confession?
I know its in your power today
To punish me with your derision.
Yet had compassion a part to play
In your thoughts, you would wait,
And not abandon me to fate. 
At first I wished to stay quite silent,
Thus, you never would have heard 
Of shame or misery, one word.
If Id reserved a hope, content
To see you but once a week,
Be in your presence, hear you speak,
Utter a few words of greeting,
And then, while you were gone,
Have that to think, and think, upon,
Day and night, till our next meeting.
Youre unsociable, they say
That the country bores you, sadly;
And we.dont shine in any way,
Although we welcome you, so gladly.

Why did you come, to disturb us?
Lost in our rural solitude?
Id not have known you, and thus
Been spared this deep inquietude,
In time (who knows?) I might have viewed
My world with equanimity, 
This fever born of youth once past,
Found another, served at last,
As wife and mother, faithfully. 

Another? No, no theres none
On earth but you my heart adores!
That was ordained by fate, alone
Its Heavens will: I am yours. 
My life was but a pledge till now
Of our prophetic meeting: yes,
God sent you to me, I avow,
Till in the grave we shall rest
You appeared to me in dreams,
My soul heard your voice ring clear,
As yet unknown, I held you dear,
Stirred by a strangers glance, it seems,
Long ago.It was no phantom!
You appeared, and instantly,
My hearts ablaze, I cried: Its he,
In my thoughts, I was struck dumb.
Is it not true? I often heard you:
In quiet, did you not speak to me,
In works of charity, all through
The hours of anguished prayer I knew, 
When my head ached so painfully?
And now, at this very moment,
Is it not you, this heaven sent
Vision, standing by my bed,
Deep, in the translucent night
To bring, with love and solace bright,
Fresh hope on which my heart is fed?

Are you then my guardian angel,
Or my tempter, force of evil:
Dispel my doubts, I am blind,
Perhaps this is all vanity,
The fancies of a foolish mind,
Mine another destiny.
So be it! My fate now lies
In your hands, my direction,
The tears flow from my eyes,
I beseech your protection
Conceive it. No one here to cherish
Me, or understand my moan,
My mind in torment, Im alone:
Silently, Im doomed to perish.
I await you: one look turned
Towards me, wake hope in my heart,
Or make this painful dream depart
Speak the reproach I have earned!

I tremble to reread.must end!
My heart sinks now, in shame and terror
On you alone I must depend
Boldly trusting in your honour


ONEGINS LETTER TO TATYANA

I foresee all: how Ill annoy
You deeply, by my sad confession:
What bitter scorn in your expression,
How proud the glance youll employ!
What can I hope for? With what aim
Reveal my soul, and thereafter
Open myself to endless blame,
Prompting your malicious laughter?

When we met, long ago, by chance,
I dared not trust the circumstance,
Refused to give rein to affection;
Though seeing the tenderness in you,
My liberty, though tedious, too,
Demanded my full attention.
And then, to part us utterly
Lenskys luckless sacrifice
I tore my heart away, completely
From the hearts true paradise;
An exile, and bound to none,
I thought that freedom and rest
Were substitutes for happiness. 
God! How I erred, and am undone!

No, to be with you constantly;
Faithfully follow in your footsteps;
And gazing in adoration see
Your slightest glance; your smiling lips;
To listen to you, and to know
Your perfection in all this;
To suffer at your feet and so
Grow paler, and then die.what bliss!
That, Im denied; and, simply
For you, still drag myself about,
Though precious time goes swiftly,
And, in vain tedium, I play out
These hours that fate has plotted,
With all their weary weight allotted.
My days are numbered, yet its true,
If I were certain at first light,
By afternoon, of seeing you,
I could endure until the night.

I fear lest this humble prayer,
May be construed by your mind
As some deceit the eye lays bare,
And your reproach repay in kind.
But if you knew this agony:
To suffer passions parching thirst, 
To burn while reason forcefully
Curbs the flames with which Im cursed.
To long to fall there, clasp your knees, 
In pain and sorrow, at your feet,
Pour out complaints, confessions, pleas,
In whatever way words can entreat 
And yet with a pretended coldness
To don a mask, in form and speech,
Make conversation, and to teach
The eye to hides its joyfulness! 

Yet so be it: here I wait:
The fight is done, the sword is still,
All is over: to your will
I surrender, and my fate.

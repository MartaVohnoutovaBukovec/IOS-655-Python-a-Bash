# Homework No 10: create a program that breaks the substitution cipher
# using 'brute force' approach by seeking patterns in the English dictionary
#
# Author: Alexandre Lysov
# Date: April 2017
#
# on Linux: python3 subst_decipher.py < emsg.txt
# on Windows: python subst_decipher.py < emsg.txt
#
# Note: all files were creaed in Windows !
# If database cannot be opened, try to delete the en_dict.db file -
# the program will attempt to recreate it from en_words.txt file.
# Be aware of possible issues with line endings between Linux and Windows.

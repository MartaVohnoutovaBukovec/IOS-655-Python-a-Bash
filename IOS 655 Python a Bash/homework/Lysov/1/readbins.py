# Homework No 1: read and translate binary strings to the original text
#
# Author: Alexandre Lysov
# Date: February 23, 2017
#
# This application reads text files, where each character of the text is represented 
# by a block of 8 binary characters (BYTE), e.i. '01001001...' with no separators.
#
# Parameter -i and file name are mandatory. 
# The decoded text from the file will be displayed to a standart output.
#
# If optional parameter -s is passed, the application will try to convert each line of the file
# to a '.wav' file and read it back in a loop. This feature requires working Internet connection.
# To conver text to speech the following libraries are needed 'pyaudio', 'wave', and 'requests'.
# However, these libraries are only being imported if the parameter -s is supplied.
#
# If speech is requested, but libraies are not istalled, the program will ignore -s.
#
# The application has been tested on Windows 10 with Python 3.5.3 with the speach option
# and on Ubuntu on Windows (so-called Bash on Windows 10) with Python 3.4.3 without speech.
